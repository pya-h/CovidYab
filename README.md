# CovidYab [CovidFinder] Android App
An android app designed to obtain the fact that how much a person can be,
under the influence of the corona virus.

# Platform: Android
Obvious!

# Language: Java, XAML
The application is designed via Android Studio.

# Description:
The application consists of two different quizzes, with two different approaches, 
two different diognosis methods, two different resulting output and even two different UIs.
The idea for both quizzes is to determine how much a person is in danger, buy asking some 
relevant questions about the disease symptoms. And at the end app shows the person,
that how much he is likely to be in different stages and levels of the disease, statistically.

# Simple Quiz:
	This quiz consists of some yes/no questions, as well as some qyestions about age and gender and so; and at the end,
	it determines, how much it is possible for him/her to be in light or normal or severe stage of the disease.
	Each percentage in the output, actually shows that how much it's possible that that person can be in,
	that stage of disease. The quiz also contains some other statistics as well.

# Tree Quiz
	This is quiz is fast, simple and cool actually; User can answer the quiz questions in a tree shape quiz,
	which answering each branch will lead to the next branch of the quiz. In this case the questions might be different in,
	some parts from the others, because it will obtain the result step by step and branch by branch and 
	it removes more other possibilities in each step;
	The result in this mode, just a word showing the possible disease stage the user is in.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
The data and formulas that construct the diognosis algorythms of the application, are based on a Bachelor's degree
final thesis, of a friend of mine; Its the result of the researches and matlab calculations of him, and i,
dont know how much this data is valid.
The only purpose of this repo, for me, is just to show my android development skills, nothing else.
